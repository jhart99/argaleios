# IPMI
Everything will be much easier if you set up IPMI on your servers.
Create an ipmi user (Administrator or your choice) and set the
password to match the contents of the ipmi_password file.  This will
let you activate serial over lan, or reboot and reformat servers with
a minimum of interaction.
